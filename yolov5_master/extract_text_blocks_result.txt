green economy make a society miserable due to the consequences of 
such a crisis (Afonso and Furceri, 2010). The scale of public expenditure 
in a green economy and the relationship between public expenditure 
composition and economic growth impact fiscal policy implementation. 
Some public expenditure components with more significant influence on 
green economic activity than others give rise to this question. Changing 
the level and composition of the total public expenditure on R&D en-
ables a country to improve its economic performance (Iram et al., 2020). 
The Belt and Road initiative (BRI) by China encourages the con-

struction of large markets through mutual cooperation centric to energy 
and infrastructure (Sun et al. 2020a, 2020b). Developing countries, 
particularly in Asia and Africa, see this as a tremendous opportunity due 
to Chinese banks’ lucrative financing offers. While most of the projects 
are predominantly executed by China, the member countries often have 
the opportunity to negotiate terms. The strategy of growth amongst the 
developing economies is shifting from agriculture to modern industrial 
manufacturing. Developing countries from Asia and Africa are trying to 
achieve a significant output to support their growth targets by focusing 
on their industrial sectors (Yang, 2017). Targeting much smooth and 
enhanced output, emerging countries among BRI members have 
increased their reliance on energy resources. However, to mitigate 
global warming, the member countries must cooperate towards green 
development, in addition to economic interests. Although the various 
authors proposed studies (Dai et al., 2015) and (˜A and Spreng, 2007) 
regarding environmental issues in the BRI region, the research is still in 
its initial phase. Due to the reliance on the industrial sector and 
non-renewable energy (NRE) resources, green economic growth has 
improved; however, the continuous degradation of the environment 
threatens the future (Montalbano and Nenci, 2019) and (Mohsin et al., 
2018). According to the literature, the BRI member countries’ economic 
growth can be significantly improved with the BRI project’s help. The 
growth targets can be achieved through energy and living standards 
(Omri, 2013 and Shah et al., 2019). Specific pointers play a role in the 
failure of green economic growth, such as too much reliance on NRE, 
inappropriate environmental planning, and insufficient public spending 
in the field of research and development (R&D) (Al-mulali, 2011; 
Acheampong, 2018). With the popular direction distance approach, this 
study establishes a “green economic growth index” (Lin and Zhu, 2019). 
Fluctuations in the economy’s progress, resource base, and environment 
scenario are considered in the index construction process. The fluctua-
tions are keenly observed in this index throughout the study. The 
investigation follows the index’s formation to measure the impact of 
education and R&D expenditure on green economic growth through the 
two-step system, called the GMM method, used to run econometric 
estimation. A positive statistical impact is noticed along with the 
composition effect and the technical effect. The composition effect is 
recorded to have a more significant impact than the technical effect 
throughout the observation (Pe˜na-Martel et al., 2018). The impact of the 
influential prospective channels of public spending on green economic 
growth is also assessed in this study. According to the results, human 
capital-based industries can be improved by public spending on the 
education sector. Similarly, technology advancement can be accelerated 
by public spending on Research and Development (Xing and Fuest, 
2018) and (Martínez-Moya et al., 2019). 
This study plays its role in providing instrumental insights for liter-

ature. This study’s result can support the role of public spending in 
affecting the green economy movement. Regardless of a consistent study 
proving this concept, The market mechanism is influenced by govern-
ment spending. This study proposes the minimised market failure 
through increased public spending with empirical evidence regarding 
the presence of composition and technique effect. In this study, green 
economic growth is recorded to positively correlate with an increase in 
fiscal spending. Data envelopement has been used to measure energy 
efficiency for selected countries. The public policy measures broadly 
impact energy conservation, economic growth, and environmental 
safety initiatives, and these three variables must have an excellent right 

balance in the green economy movement. According to this study, 
governments can foster green economic development by increasing 
spending on public properties, concluding with some suggestions for the 
BRI countries to achieve sustainable economic development. The het-
erogeneity of the sample countries is evident in this study. Hence, in 
order for different countries to benefit from public spending for green 
economic growth (green public finance), it is vital to form different 
development initiatives. 
The remaining sections of the study are stated as: Section 2 presents 
detailed literature on green economics, section 3 introduces the data and 
methodology, section 4 presents an analysis on the empirical study, 
section 5 is based on the conclusion and policy recommendations. 

2. The green economy: role of clean energy 

The global sustainable development for energy and the environment 
relatively depends on BRI construction (Zhang and Zhang, 2018). With 
one-third of the global GDP in energy, an estimated 62% of the global 
population, 39% of the global land area, 24% of household consump-
tion, and approximately half of the world’s total energy consumption is 
based on the countries along the “Belt and Road” (IEA, 2016; see Fig. 1 
for the map of BRI). Therefore, the total energy intensity or the energy 
input per unit GDP is higher for this region, reflecting countries’ po-
tential along the “Belt and Road” for cleaning through the production 
process (Qi et al., 2019). The improvement of the basic connectivity of 
trade and investment between the Silk Road land and Silk Road sea 
routes is one of the primary objectives for the “Belt and Road” con-
struction. It is also essential for the countries along the “Belt and Road” 
to decrease heat consumption through government spending on 
research and development to achieve economic growth. Demand for 
high-quality investment in the energy sector is supported by the lack of 
energy infrastructure, which is one of the main hurdles in achieving 
sustainable economic development in the countries along with the “Belt 
and Road,” most of which are emerging economies and developing 
countries (Liu et al., 2020). 
It is easy to define a green economy as resource-efficient, low-carbon 
(clean), and socially inclusive. In a green economy, the growth of 
employment and income is driven by public and private investment. 
Such green investments propel economic activities, including green 
energy infrastructure development to reduce carbon emissions, improve 
energy and resource efficiency, and protect biodiversity and ecosystems 
(Sun et al. 2020a, 2020b). As a result, green economic growth has gained 
attention as a new form of economic mechanism worldwide (Rodri-
guez-Gonzalez et al., 2018). A precise definition of the green economy is 
evident in previous studies (Anser, 2019) and (Tehreem et al., 2020). A 
green economy is termed as a strategic concept responsible for analysing 
the concept and meaning of “green growth”, according to some inter-
national agencies’ claims, such as the UNEP (2011). The relationship 
between sustainable development, green economy and green economy’s 
dimensional characteristics with bibliometric analysis is studied in Nieto 
et al. (2018). Public finance is not enough to achieve green development 
goals and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by The United 
Nations, according to Yoshino et al. (2020) and Taghizadeh-Hesary and 
Yoshino (2019). Therefore, the government needs to allow green 
infrastructural projects to bring more private green finance and in-
vestments (Zhang et a. 2019; Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino, 2020). 
Green economy and growth are discussed in the literature in great 
detail. By adopting a green economy, we can produce low carbon 
discharge and preserve green resources (Lin and Jia 2018). According to 
some studies, environmental safety and employment generation can 
help green growth in ensuring economic development. (Iqbal et al., 
2020). Wang et al. (2019) applied the input-output measure of energy to 
study the prospective direction for Canada’s green economy under 
various phenomena. The growth efficiency of green economies of Chi-
nese cities is studied by Zhao et al. (2017). The extent of green economic 
development in Chinese cities considering various resources is assessed
